# Java-Codespace
While searching on GitHub, I really missed a repository that will contain the Java codes for every coding problem.
Thus, this repository is open for everyone to contribute the codes as well as the problem statement , most preferably in Java.
<br>
So what are you waiting for? Bang On! Contribute your codes here and maintain a Github Contribution streak.
😁
Note#1 -> Create a seperate folder and include your code file as well as problem statement
<br>
Note#2 -> Try to always include a special type of solution
