Problem Statement => 
Newton has N pencils of variable lengths L1, L2, ... , LN.

He wants to have 3 specific length pencils of length X, Y, and Z. If he doesn't have these length pencils in his N pencils stash, then he will create it.

Newton knows magic and he can do 3 magic tricks to change pencil lengths.
1) He can choose any pencil and increase its length by 1. It consumes 1 second of his time.
2) He can choose any pencil and decrease its length by 1. It consumes 1 second of his time.
3) He can choose any 2 pencils of length Li and Lj and merge them to create a single pencil of length Li + LJ. It consumes 10 seconds of his time.

Since Newton doesn't like to waste time, he wants you to tell him the minimum time needed to get pencils with length X, Y and Z.
