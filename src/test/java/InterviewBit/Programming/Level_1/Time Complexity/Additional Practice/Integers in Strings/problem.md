# [Problem: Integers in Strings](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/integers-in-strings/)

Given a string **A**, consisting of comma-separated positive integers.
Extract the given integers from the string and return an integer array consisting of the integers present in the string.

**Note: All given integers will fit in a 32-bit signed integer.**

## Input

The first and only argument is a string **A**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ A ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>**

## Output

Return an integer array.
The array should contain all the integers in the same order as they appear in the string.

## Sample

- Input:
```
A = "1,2,3"
A = "1,99,3"
```

- Output:
```
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 99, 3]
