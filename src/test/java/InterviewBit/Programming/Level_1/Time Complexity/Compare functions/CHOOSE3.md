In a competition, four different functions are observed. **All the functions use a single for loop and within the for loop, same set of statements are executed.** <br>

Consider the following for loops: <br>

  A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++) <br>
 
  B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2) <br>
 
  C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2) <br>
 
  D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2) <br>
**If n is the size of input(positive), which function is the most efficient? In other words, which loop completes the fastest.**

- A
- B
- C
- D

**Answer C**
