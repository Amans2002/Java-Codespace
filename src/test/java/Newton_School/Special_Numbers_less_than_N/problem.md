# [Problem: Special Numbers less than N](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/st4b862el44c)

You are given an integer N. Find the number of integers less than equal to N that are special. <br>
A number x is said to be special if F(x+1) < F(x), where F(x)= the sum of digits of x. For example F(14)=5, F(7)=7.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer N.

## Constraints
