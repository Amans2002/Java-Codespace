# [Problem: Distribution of Apples](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/s5hupj0oam3o)

You have n apples and m people. Each apple weighs exactly 1 kg. To distribute the apples among the people, you can cut each apple into halves as many times as needed. Determine if it's possible to distribute the apples among the m people such that each person gets an equal weight of apples.

## Input

Input contains two space separated integers n and m where (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9)

## Output

Print "Yes" if it's possible to divide the apples equally among the m people, "No" otherwise.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3 4
```

- Output:
```
Yes
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Each person gets, 0.75Kg. To divide, we can divide, two apples in two halves, 0.5 each. and one in four parts, 0.25 each. Now distribute two pieces (0.5 and 0.75) to each person.**
