# [Problem: Find X](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/ri7s8g5q4pzd)

Let's consider a table consisting of **n rows and n columns**. The cell located at the intersection of **i<sup>th</sup> row and j<sup>th</sup> column** contains number **i × j**. The rows and columns are numbered starting from **1**. You are given a positive integer **x**. Your task is to count the number of cells in a table that contain number **x**.

## Input

The input consists of two space- separated integers **n and x**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>** <br>
**1 ≤ x ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print a single number: the number of times **x** occurs in the table.

## Sample

- Input:
```
10 5
6 12
```

- Output:
```
2
4
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **(1,5) and (5,1)** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **(2,6), (3,4), (4,3) and (6,2)** <br>
- For case 3: <br> **21:00 + 100 => 60 min = 1 hr <br> 21 + 1 = 22 and 100 - 60 = 40 <br> 22:40** <br>
