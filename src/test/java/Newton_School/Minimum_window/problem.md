# [Problem: Minimum window](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/54y3i82qi24c)

You are given an array A. The array contains all the elements in the range of 1 to K. Determine the minimum size of the subarray that contains all the K distinct elements.

## Input

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the array and K.
- The second line of each test case contains N space- separated integers.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ T ≤ 10 <br>
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 <br>
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^4**

## Output

Print the minimum size of the subarray that contains all the K distinct elements.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 2 3 1
```

- Output:
```
3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **There's a continuous segment 2, 3, 1 which contains all the K distinct elements.**
