You're given three integers (num1, num2, num3), you need to determine whether one of the numbers is the difference between the other two numbers. If such a number exists, return "Yes". Otherwise, return "No".

## Input

The only line of the input contains three space separated integers representing num1, num2 and num3.

## Constraints

**-10^6 ≤ num1, num2, num3 ≤ 10^6**

## Output

Print "Yes" if one of the numbers is the difference between the other two numbers, otherwise return "No".

## Sample

- Input:
```
15 7 8
```
