You are given two integers, N and K. Your task is to determine how many numbers from 1 to N (inclusive) have a sum of digits equal to K.

## Input

Input consists of a single line containing two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) and K (1 ≤ K ≤ 81).

## Output

Print a single integer representing the count of numbers from 1 to N that have a sum of digits equal to K.

## Sample

- Input:
```
100 5
```

- Output:
```
6
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Between 1 and 100, the numbers 5, 14, 23, 32, 41 and 50 have a sum of digits equal to 5.**
