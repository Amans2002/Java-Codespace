# [Problem: Add or Subtract](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/puzlhmodh4jq)

You are given two numbers X and Y.
If X is a divisor of Y, then print X + Y or else print Y - X.

## Input

The first line of the input contains 2 integers X and Y.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ 100**

## Output

Print the answer

## Sample

- Input:
```
10 20

4 5
```

- Output:
```
30

1
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Here, X=10 and Y=20. Since X is a divisor of Y (20 is divisible by 10), we add X and Y together. So, 10 + 20 = 30.** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **Here, X=4 and Y=5. Since X is not a divisor of Y (5 is not divisible by 4), we subtract X from Y. So, 5 - 4 = 1.** <br>
