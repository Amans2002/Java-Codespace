# [Problem: Aditi and Number System](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/dbee2llz3gim)

Aditi decided to list down all natural numbers from **1 to n** in the following order:
She first writes down all odd integers from **1 to n** (in ascending order), then all even integers from **1 to n** (also in ascending order). Help her find the integer at position **k**.

## Input

The input consists of two space-separated integers **n and k**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤  k ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>12</sup>**

## Output

Print the number that will stand at position number **k**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
10 3
7 7
```

- Output:
```
5
6
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8 10** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **1 3 5 7 2 4 6**
