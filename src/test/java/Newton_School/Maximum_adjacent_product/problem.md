# [Problem: Maximum adjacent product](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/7hxs17xlnx8w)

You are given an array(A) of integers. Your task is to find the maximum product that can be obtained from a pair of adjacent numbers in the array.
Return the maximum product of adjacent pair of numbers.

## Input

First line contain length of array. An array of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>5) Each element of the array is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000].

## Output

An integer representing the maximum product of adjacent pair of numbers in the array.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
3 5 7 4
```

- Output:
```
35
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The products of adjacent numbers are:
[3*5, 5*7, 7*4]
[15, 35, 28]
Hence, the maximum product is 35.**
