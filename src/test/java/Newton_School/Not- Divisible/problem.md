# [Problem: Not- Divisible](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/nfc61tetv8wn)

Given two integers **N and K**. You are given the task of finding **(K+N)<sup>th</sup>** positive integer that is not divisible by **N**.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers denoting **N and K**.

## Constraints

**2 ≤ N, K ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the required answer.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3 4
```

- Output:
```
10
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 ... are the numbers not divisible by 3.
Hence (K+N)-th number is 10.**
