# [Problem: Divisible by 200](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/l8upy7retswu)

You are given an integer N. Do the following operation K times on it and print the resulting integer. If N is a multiple of 200, divide it by 200. Otherwise, see N as a string and append 200 to the end of it. For example, 7 would become 7200, and 1234 would become 1234200.
