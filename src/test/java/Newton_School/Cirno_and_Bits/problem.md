# [Problem: Cirno and Bits](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/4q8h4e11j4sm)

Cirno's perfect bitmasks classroom has just started! Cirno gave her students a positive integer **x**. As an assignment, her students need to find the minimum positive integer **y**, which satisfies the following two conditions:
1. **x and y>0**
2. **x xor y>0**  <br>

Where **and** is the bitwise **AND operation**, and **xor** is the bitwise **XOR operation**.

## Input

 The input consists of an integer **x**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ x ≤ 2<sup>30</sup>** <br>

## Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of **y**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1
5
```

- Output:
```
