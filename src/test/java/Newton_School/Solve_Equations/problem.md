# [Problem: Solve Equations](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/x0k0xpl9hdfw)

You are given two integers - n, m. Find the number of pairs (a, b) such that
- a^2 + b = n
- a + b^2 = m
<br>
Both a and b are greater than 0.

## Input

Input contains two integers- n and m. (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000)

## Output

Output the number of pairs (a, b).

## Sample

- Input:
```
9 3
```

- Output:
```
1
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **In the sample the suitable pair is integers (3, 0). In the second sample the suitable pair is integers (3, 5). In the third sample there is no suitable pair.**
