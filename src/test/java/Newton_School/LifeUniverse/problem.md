Problem Statement => You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of N vertices
 (numbered 1 to N) and N edges. Let d(u, v) denote the shortest distance between nodes u and v in the graph. 
 You need to find the sum of d(u, v) over all pairs (u, v) such that d(u,v)^K.
 Since this sum can be large, you need to print it modulo 998244353.
