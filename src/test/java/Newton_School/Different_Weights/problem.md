# [Problem: Different Weights](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/g67slhet0xx9)

Let's define a split of n as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is n. <br>
For example, the following sequences are splits of 8 : [4, 4], [3, 3, 2], [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [5, 2, 1] <br>
The following sequences aren't splits of 8: [1, 7], [5, 4], [11, âˆ’3], [1, 1, 4, 1, 1] <br>
The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is 5, the weight of the split [5, 5, 3, 3, 3] is 2 and the weight of the split [9] equals 1. <br>
For a given n, find out the number of different weights of its splits <br>
