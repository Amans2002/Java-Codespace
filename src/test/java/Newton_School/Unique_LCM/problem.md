# [Problem: Unique LCM](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/cmt6gh0id94h)

You are given an integer **X**. Your task is to iterate from **1** to **10<sup>18</sup> and in each iteration **i**, you have to write **(lcm(X, i))/(i)** on your notebook. Find out the number of different integers written on the notebook.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer **X**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ X ≤ 10<sup>10</sup>**

## Output

Print the required answer.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **LCM of (2, i) is always equal to i or 2*i, therefore (lcm(X, i))/(i) = 1 or 2.**
