# [Problem: Number of extensions needed!](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/cdk3cvqla2xe)

Newton has shifted to a new house and it came to his notice that there is only one socket in his house !!! Newton does a lot of experiments using electricity and wants at least B sockets in his house. Furthermore, he has an ample amount of extension cords and each extension has A sockets and takes one socket. In others words, an extension cord extends one socket into A sockets. You need to tell Newton how many extension cords will be required so that he can have at least B sockets.

## Input

The first and the only line of the input contains 2 single integers A and B

## Constraints

**1) 2 ≤ A ≤ 200 <br>
2) 1 ≤ B ≤ 200**

## Output

Print the answer

## Sample

- Input:
```
4 10

8 9
```

- Output:
```
3 2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **3 power strips, each with 4 sockets, extend the socket into 10 empty sockets.**
