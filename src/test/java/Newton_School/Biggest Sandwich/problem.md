# [Problem: Biggest Sandwich](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/j4ohpsfls1dl)

Chem Emma has now decided to make the biggest sandwich from the available resources. To make the sandwich she wraps the first slice of cheese between the two breads, and after that she keeps adding a slice and a bread to make it bigger. <br>
Sandwich : ( bread - cheese - bread - cheese - bread. . . . . . . .  cheese - bread) <br>
She had gathered n pieces of bread and m slices of cheese. Help her determine the maximum height of the sandwich, assuming that each layer ( bread or cheese has a height of 1 unit).

## Input

The only line of input contains two space separated integers n and m representing the number of pieces of bread and the number of cheese slices.

## Constraints

**0 <= n, m <= 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print an integer representing the maximum height of the sandwich Emma can make.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 3
```

- Output:
```
7
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The sandwich looks like:
(bread - cheese - bread - cheese - bread - cheese - bread), Now no cheese slices are left. So Emma cannot add more cheese or bread.**
