# [Problem: Count the grids](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/3maci183ureq)

Given a value N. In how many ways you can construct a grid of size N x 4 using tiles of size 1 x 4?
**NOTE: The answer can be very large.**

## Input

There is a single line of input that takes an integer as input representing N.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 80**

## Output

Print an integer representing the number of ways you can construct a grid of size N x 4 using tiles of size 1 x 4.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1

4
```

- Output:
```
1

2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **N = 1
We can arrange the tiles horizontally and this is the only way.** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **N = 4
The first way is when all the 1 x 4 tiles are arranged horizontally.
The second way can be when all the 1 x 4 tiles are arranged vertically.**
