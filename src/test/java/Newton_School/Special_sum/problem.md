# [Problem: Special sum](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/eftatnayt779)

You are given an integer **N**. You have to find the sum of all natural numbers from **1 to N** but all the power of **2** will be added with a negative sign. <br>
**For example, if N = 5, then sum = -1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 = 1, since 1, 2, and 4 are powers of 2.**

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **N**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print in a single line the required sum.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
```

- Output:
```
-4
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **sum = -1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -4**
