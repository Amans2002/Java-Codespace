# [Problem: Divide the Mangoes](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/abeweuvs0tuw)

You have n mangoes and m people. Each mango weighs exactly 1 kg. To distribute the mangoes among the people, you can cut each mango into halves as many times as needed. Determine if it's possible to distribute the mangoes among the m people such that each person gets an equal weight of mangoes.

## Input

Input contains two space separated integers n and m where (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>)

## Constraints

**1 ≤ K ≤ 100** <br>
**K** is an integer.

## Output

Print "Yes" if it's possible to divide the mangoes equally among the m people, "No" otherwise.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3 4
```

- Output:
```
Yes
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Each person gets, 0.75Kg. To divide, we can divide, two mangoes in two halves, 0.5 each. and one in four parts, 0.25 each. Now distribute two pieces (0.5 and 0.75) to each person.**
