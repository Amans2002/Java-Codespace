# [Problem: Multiple Of 7](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/htm1y4kpdz5r)

Yash loves the number 7 and multiples of K. Where is the first occurrence of a multiple of K in the sequence 7, 77, 777, …? If the sequence contains no multiples of K, print -1 instead.

## Input

The input consists of an integer K.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6** <br>
**K** is an integer.

## Output

Print an integer representing the position of the first occurrence of a multiple of K.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2

101
```

- Output:
```
-1

4
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **In the sequence of multiples of 7 (7, 77, 777, ...), there is no number which is a multiple of 2. Hence, the output is -1.** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **In the sequence of multiples of 7 (7, 77, 777, 7777, ...), the first number which is a multiple of 101 is 7777 and its position is 4. Hence, the output is 4.**
