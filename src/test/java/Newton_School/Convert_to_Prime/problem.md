# [Problem: Convert to Prime](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/ldoowf39wjiz)

Given an array of n integers. Find the minimum non- negative number to be inserted in array, so that sum of all elements of array becomes prime.

## Input

Input consists of two lines:
- The first line contains an integer n : the size of the array.
- The second line contains n space separated integers representing the array elements.

## Constraints

**1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup> <br>
1 <= arr[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup>**

## Output

Print the desired integer.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5
2 4 6 8 12
```

- Output:
```
5
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The sum of the array is 32, we can add 5 to this to make it 37 which is a prime number.**
