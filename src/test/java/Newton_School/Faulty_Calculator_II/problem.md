# [Problem: Faulty Calculator II](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/719bs8061j9b)

You have bought a new calculator, but it seems to be faulty: all its results have an extra 0 appended to the end. For example, if you ask it for 3 + 5, it'll print 80, and 4 + 12 will result in 160. <br>
Given two integers A and B, Print the value given by the calculator on doing A + B?

## Input

You are given two space separated integers on the same line, A & B-<br>
- A (1 <= A <= 10^5): An integer representing the first operand.
- B (1 <= B <= 10^5): An integer representing the second operand.

## Output

An integer representing the calculator's output when you enter A + B into it.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 2
```

- Output:
```
70
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **5 + 2 = 7. Append an extra 0, so 70.**
