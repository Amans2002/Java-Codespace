Seven colleagues eagerly gathered for a memorable team dinner at a luxurious restaurant. Laughter filled the air, and the excitement grew with each passing moment. As the dishes arrived, they indulged in a feast, savoring every bite. However, when the moment of truth arrived, they were taken aback. The bill was presented, and the team leader, who was assumed to be paying, revealed that each team member must contribute their fair share. Now, the challenge lies in designing an algorithm that calculates the amount each team member should contribute to ensure a fair distribution of the bill.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a number n representing the number of items they ordered for the dinner.
- The second line of the input contains n space separated integers representing the price of each item.
- **4<=n<=10^4 <br> 10<=array_elements<=499**

- The sum of array elements doesn't exceed 10^8 over all test cases

## Output

Return the amount(correct upto 2 decimal places) that each person have to contribute to ensure a fair distribution of the bill.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
825 180 260 265
