# [Problem: Closest power](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/qe73agabfthv)

You're given a positive integer n, determine the closest number which is a power of 2. If two powers of 2 are equidistant from n, print the smaller one. 

## Input

Input contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^8).

## Output

Print the closest power of 2. If two powers of 2 are equidistant from n, print the smaller one.

## Sample

- Input:
```
34

12
```

- Output:
```
32

8
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Closest power of two is 32 from this number.** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **Closest powers of two are 8 and 16. Both have difference of 4. Hence the answer is the smaller one.** <br>
