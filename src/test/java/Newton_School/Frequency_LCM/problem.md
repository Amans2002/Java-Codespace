# [Problem: Frequency LCM](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/nyox0dkseg5s)

Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the frequencies of all characters in a given string **'s'**.

## Input

The first line of input contains string **'s'**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ s. length ≤ 100** <br>
The string 's' consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Output

Print the **least common multiple (LCM)** of the frequencies of all characters in a given string **'s'**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
abca
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **frequency of 'a' = 2,
frequency of 'b' = 1,
frequency of 'c' = 1,
LCM(2, 1, 1) = 2.**
