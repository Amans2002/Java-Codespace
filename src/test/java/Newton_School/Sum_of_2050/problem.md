# [Problem: Sum of 2050](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/ixzyutlppmt5)

A number is called **2050**- number if it is **2050, 20500,. , (2050⋅10<sup>k</sup> for integer k ≥ 0)**. Given a number **n**, you are asked to represent **n** as the sum of some (not necessarily distinct) **2050** - numbers. Compute the minimum number of **2050** - numbers required for that.

## Input

The input consists of an integer **N**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>18</sup>**

## Output

Output the minimum number of **2050** - numbers in one line. If **n** cannot be represented as the sum of **2050** - numbers, output −1 instead.

## Sample

- Input:
```
205
4100
```

- Output:
```
-1
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: **205<2050** <br>
- For case 2: **4100=2500*2**
