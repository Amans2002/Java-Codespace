# [Problem: Factorial sum](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/cqvzd9uo7rjh)

Given an integer n, calculate the sum of the factorials of each of its digits. <br>
A factorial of a non- negative integer x, denoted by x!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to x. For instance, 5!=5×4×3×2×1=120.

## Input

Input consists of an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

## Output

Print an integer denoting the sum of the factorials of the digits of n.

## Sample

- Input:
```
123
```

- Output:
```
9
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The answer is (1! + 2! + 3!) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9.**
