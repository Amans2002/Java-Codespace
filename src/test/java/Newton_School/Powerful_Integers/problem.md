# [Problem: Powerful Integers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/65w7j1ftyp6m)

Let's call a positive integer powerful if it has only one non- zero digits. For example, **5000, 4, 1, 10, and 200** are powerful integers whereas **42, 13, 666, 77, and 101** are not. <br>
You are given an integer **n**. You have to calculate the number of powerful integers **x** such that **1 ≤ x ≤ n**.

## Input

The input consists of an integer **n**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ 999999** <br>

## Output

Print one integer denoting the number of extremely round integers **x** such that **1 ≤ x ≤ n**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
9
42
```

- Output:
```
9
13
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **Numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,30,40**
