# [Problem: Max numbers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/6aju4sfwrria)

Given a sequence of N numbers, you need to find its maximum, 2nd maximum and 3rd maximum element.

## Input

The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. <br>
For each test case, the first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the list A. The following line contains N (space-separated) elements of A.

## Constraints

**1 <= T <= 100 <br>
3 <= N <= 10<sup>6</sup> <br>
1 <= A[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup> <br>
Note:-It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10<sup>6</sup>**

## Output

For each test case, output the first, second and third maximum elements in the list.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3
5
1 4 2 4 5
6
1 3 5 7 9 8
7
11 22 33 44 55 66 77
```

- Output:
```
5 4 4
9 8 7
77 66 55

```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **[1 4 2 4 5] 
First max = 5 
Second max = 4 
Third max = 4**
