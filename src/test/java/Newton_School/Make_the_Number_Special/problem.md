# [Problem: Make the Number Special](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/blhdqbjy2f5r)

You are given a string num representing a non-negative integer. In one operation, you can pick any digit of num and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of num, num becomes 0.<br>
Determine the minimum number of operations required to make num special.<br.
**Note: An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by 5.**

## Input

The first line of the input consist of a single positive integer num as a string.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ |num| ≤ 1000**

## Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of operations required to make num special.

## Sample

- Input:
```
22547
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **If we delete 4 and 7 from the last, we get a number 225 which is divisible by 5.**
