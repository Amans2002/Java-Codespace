# [Problem: Minimize stones](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/nvyz90ze80lt)

You are given unlimited stone worth **1, 2,... , n**. You have to select some stones whose worth adds up to **S**. <br>
**Note: You can choose multiple stones of the same worth.**
What is the minimum number of stones required to get the sum **S**?

## Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers **N and S**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> <br>
1 ≤ S ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the minimum number of stones required to obtain the sum **S**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 11
```

- Output:
```
3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **some of the possible ways to get a sum of 11 with 3 coins are: <br>
(3, 4, 4) <br>
(2, 4, 5) <br>
(1, 5, 5) <br>
(3, 3, 5) <br>
It is impossible to get a sum of 11 with less than 3 coins.**
