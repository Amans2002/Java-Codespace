# [Problem: Divisor greater than 1](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/gacasjr6kmoq)

You are given an integer **N**. You have to find out whether there exists a number **K** such that
- K is odd
- K is greater than 1.
- N%K==0. <br>
**Print YES if it exists otherwise print NO**

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **N**.

## Constraints

**2 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>14</sup>**

## Output

Print on a separate line **YES** if the conditions mentioned in the question are met otherwise print **NO**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
18
```

- Output:
```
YES
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The K value that exists here is 3, as 3 is odd and also 18%3 == 0 and 3 > 1, so it met all the mentioned conditions hence the answer is YES.**
