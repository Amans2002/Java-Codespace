# [Problem: Sockets needed](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/9clunragm5sn)

You have recently moved to a new house and realized there is only one socket available! Given your passion for conducting electricity experiments, you need at least B sockets in your new place. Fortunately, you have plenty of extension cords, and each extension has A sockets, utilizing one socket. In simpler terms, an extension cord extends one socket into A sockets. Can you figure out how many extension cords you'll need to ensure you have a minimum of B sockets for your experiments?

## Input

The first and the only line of the input contains 2 single integers A and B

## Constraints

**2 ≤ A ≤ 200 <br>
1 ≤ B ≤ 200**

## Output

Print the answer

## Sample

- Input:
```
4 10
```

- Output:
```
3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **3 power strips, each with 4 sockets, extend the socket into 10 empty sockets.**
