# [Problem: Increase the rows](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/i6eycf7efhx6)

You are having a matrix of **N** rows and **M** columns. You decided to increase the number of rows of matrix by **X**, calculate the total number of cells in the matrix after addition of extra rows?

## Input

The first line of the input contains three space- separated integers **N, M and X**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N, M, X ≤ 100**

## Output

Output on a new line, a single integer, which should be the final total number of cells in the matrix.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 2 1
```

- Output:
```
12
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **There are initially 5 rows, and 2 columns. So the initial number of cells was 5∗2=10. Then, 1 extra row was added. So now the table has 6 rows, and 2 columns. So the total number of cells is now 6∗2=12, which is the answer.** <br>
