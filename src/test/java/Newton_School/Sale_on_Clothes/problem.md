# [Problem: Sale on Clothes](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/t1z4vk5gtpti)

Abhilash opened a clothes shop but due to the global recession in the market, there is less demand for clothes. Being a business- minded Abhilash knew that when people see a discount offered on a product, they are more likely to buy it. Therefore, he decides to first increase the price of these clothes by **x%(from p i. e original price) and then offer a discount of x% to people.**
Please help Abhilash find the total loss incurred due to this sale, if all the **q** clothes are sold out. <br>

**Note
The test cases are designed in such a way that you don't need to worry about decimal. You just have to care about integer values.**

## Input

The only line contains the three space- separated integers denoting the original **price(p), quantity(q) and discount%(x)** of the clothes.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ p, q ≤ 100
0 ≤ x ≤ 100**

## Output

Print the total amount of money loss.

## Sample

- Input:
```
100 5 10
```

- Output:
```
5
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Abhilash first increases the price of each cloth by 10%, from 100 to 110. After that, he decreases the price by 10%, which makes the final price 99. The amount of money lost for each unit is 1, thus there are 5 items so total loss = 5*1=5**
