# [Problem: Pythagorean Triplet](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/dpum8d9z25k3)

Given an array arr of n integers. Find if there is a triplet (a, b, c) from the array (where a, b, and c are on different indexes) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2. <br>
If such a triplet exists, Print "Yes" else "No".

## Input

Input consists of two lines:
- The first line contains an integer n : the size of the array.
- The second line contains n space separated integers representing the array elements.

## Constraints

**1 <= n <= 10^3 <br>
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5**

## Output

Print "Yes" or "No"

## Sample

- Input:
```
5
3 2 4 6 5
```

- Output:
```
Yes
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **a=3, b=4, and c=5 forms a Pythagorean triplet.**
