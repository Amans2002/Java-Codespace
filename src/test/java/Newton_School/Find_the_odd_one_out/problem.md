You're given an integer array, in which each element is present thrice except for one. Find the number that is present only once.

## Input

Input consists of two lines:
- The first line contains an integer n : the size of the array.
- The second line contains n space separated integers representing the array elements.

## Constraints

**1 <= n <= 10^5 <br>
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5**

## Output

Print an integer, that has the single occurence.

## Sample

- Input:
```
7
0 1 0 1 99 1 0
