# [Problem: XOR of even divisors](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/1eaiu9onn29m)

You are given a number **n**, and you have to tell **XOR** of all even divisors of **n**.

## Input

The first line of input contains a single integer **n**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6<sup>**

## Output

Print XOR of all even divisors of **n**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
8
```

- Output:
```
14
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **All even divisors of 8 = 2, 4, 8.
XOR(2, 4, 8) = 14.**
