# [Problem: Aditi and Her Business](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/9o3i55eflejp)

Aditi runs a business for exactly **n** days. She knows that on the **i<sup>th</sup>** day **(1 ≤ i ≤ n)** she makes **a<sub>i</sub>** money. She wants to know the length of the maximum non- decreasing subsegment in sequence **a<sub>i</sub>**. Help Aditi to find the required result.

## Input

The first line of the input consists of an integer **n**. The second line of the input consists of **n** space- separated integers **a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,. , a<sub>n</sub>**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print a single integer denoting the length of the maximum non- decreasing subsegment of sequence **a**.
