# [Problem: Different characters](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/lcogqi89cbzi)

You are given two strings **a** and **b**. Your task is to find the number of indices where string **a** differs from string **b**. (Note: Strings are case insensitive i. e. Hello is same as hELLo).

## Input

The input consists of two lines:
<br>
The first line contains string a (1 <= |a| <= 10^4), representing the first string.
The second line contains string b (|b| = |a|), representing the second string.

## Output

Print an integer, the count of places where the two strings differ.

## Sample

- Input:
```
a = "NewtonSchool"
b = "newrOnTshool"
```

- Output:
```
3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The strings differ at index 3, 6 and 7. Hence the output is 3.**
