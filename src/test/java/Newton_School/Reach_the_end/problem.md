# [Problem: Reach the end](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/w5gekalrd8u8)

There are N points on the road, you can step ahead by 1 or 2. Starting from a point 0, you can only move from point 0 to point 1 after taking a step of length one, find the number of ways you can reach at point N. <br>
Since the answer can be very large, use modulo 1000000007. 

## Input

An integer, N (2 <= N <= 10^5)

## Output

An integer, representing the number of jumps.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
```

- Output:
```
5
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Three ways to reach at 4th point. They are {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 1} {2, 1, 1}, {2, 2}.**
