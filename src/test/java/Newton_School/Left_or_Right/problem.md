# [Problem: Left or Right](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/r65n9f5a2tcb)

You are standing on **0** on a number line. Your task is to reach **N** using a minimum number of moves. In one move you can take **2 or 3** steps left or right from the current position.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **N**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the minimum number of moves required to reach **N**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **At first, we take 2 steps left and reach the coordinate -2, then from there we take 3 steps to the right and we reach -2+3 = 1(=N). Therefore we can reach 1 from 0 using 2 steps which are the minimum possible.**
