# [Problem: Playing with 2 and 3](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/6x1h64zuf8lu)

You are given two numbers **N and M**. In one step you can multiply **N** with **2 or 3**. Find the number of steps required to convert **N to M**. If it is impossible to convert **N to M**, print **-1**.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer **N**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the number of steps required to convert **N to M**, if it is not possible print **-1**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
13 78
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **One of the possible ways can be 13 * 2 = 26 * 3= 78. (2 steps)**
