# [Problem: Minimum operations to make balls D times](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/8v2kopithl6u)

There is a container with A cyan balls. Alexa will do the following operation as many times as he likes (possibly zero times): Add B cyan balls and C red balls into the container. Alexa's objective is to reach a situation where the number of cyan balls in the container is at most D times the number of red balls in it. Determine whether the objective is achievable. If it is achievable, find the minimum number of operations needed to achieve it.

## Input

The input contains 4 space-separated numbers:
**A B C D**

## Constraints

**1 ≤ A, B, C, D ≤ 10^5** <br>
All values in the input are integers.

## Output

If Alexa's objective is achievable, print the minimum number of operations needed to achieve it. Otherwise, print -1.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 2 3 2

6 9 2 3
```

- Output:
```
2

-1
```
