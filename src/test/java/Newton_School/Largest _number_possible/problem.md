# [Problem: Largest number possible](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/77ya1pqlym2e)

Given two numbers 'N' and 'S', find the largest number that can be formed with 'N' digits and whose sum of digits should be equal to 'S'. Return -1 if it is not possible.<br>
NOTE:  N and S are very large so consider the largest number as a string.

## Input

There will be a single line of input that contains two space-separated integers representing N and S.

## Constraints

**11 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ S ≤ 10^5**

## Output

Print an integer representing the largest number that can be formed else print -1 if not possible.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2 9

3 20
```

- Output:
```
90

992
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **N = 2, S = 9
It is the biggest number with the sum of digits equal to 9.** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **N = 3, S = 20
It is the biggest number with the sum of digits equal to 20.**
