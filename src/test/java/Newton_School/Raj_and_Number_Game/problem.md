# [Problem: Raj and Number Game](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/8c918s1onie8)

Raj likes to play with numbers. He is given integers N and K. Find the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b, b+c, and c+a are all multiples of K. The order of a, b, and c does matter, and some of them can be the same.

## Input

The input line contains N and K separated by space.

## Constraints

**1≤N, K≤2×10^5**

N and K are integers.

## Output

Print the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b, b+c, and c+a are all multiples of K.
