# [Problem: Find the minimum integer](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/lnhxwv7bkkpe)

You are given three integers **X, Y, and Z**. Your task is to find out the minimum integer **P** such that it does not belong to the range **[X, Y]** (X and Y both inclusive) and **P** is divisible by **Z**.

## Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers **X, Y, and Z**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the minimum integer **P** which satisfies all the conditions.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2 4 2
```

- Output:
```
6
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **6 does not belong to the range [2, 4] and 6 is divisible Z (6%2==0).
Also, it is the minimum possible answer.**
