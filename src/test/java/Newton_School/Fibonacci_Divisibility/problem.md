# [Problem: Fibonacci Divisibility](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/z61ydskjg1i1)

Given a positive integer n, find out if there exists an integer k such that the kth Fibonacci number is divisible by n. If such a k exists, return it. Otherwise, print -1.

## Input

Input consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

## Output

Print an integer: the value of k if it exists, otherwise -1.

## Sample

- Input:
```
13
```

- Output:
```
7
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The 7th Fibonacci number is 13. Hence, it's divisible by 13.**
