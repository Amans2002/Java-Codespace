# [Problem: Rearrange the digits](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/vqmaj8hpk8ha)

You are given a positive number **N**. You have to rearrange the digits such that all the odd digit appears before the even digit such that their relative ordering doesn't change.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **N**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>18</sup>**

## Output

Print the required rearranged number.

## Sample

- Input:
```
72345
```

- Output:
```
73524
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **7, 3, and 5 are odd digits so they should be placed before and in the same order as they are in the original number. 2 and 4 are placed after that.**
