# [Problem: IRCTC Rule](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/4jxq8srohdwr)

Abhilash is traveling by train and he comes to know about the new rule of IRCTC. The new rule of IRCTC says that the total sum of the weights of the bags that are carried by the goods train per person cannot exceed **D** kgs and the weight of the bag which is carried along with the person on the traveling train cannot exceed **E** kgs. <br>
Abhilash has **3 bags** that he wants to take with him. They weigh **A, B, and C kgS** respectively. He wants to send exactly two of these bags by goods train and carry the remaining 1 bag with the same traveling train. <br>
Print(without quotes) **"yes"** if Abhilash is allowed to take all three bags otherwise print **"no"**

## Input

The only line contains all 5 integers **A, B, C, D, and E** respectively.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ A, B, C ≤10 <br>
15 ≤ D ≤ 20 <br>
5 ≤ E ≤ 10**

## Output

Print(without quotes) **"yes"** if Abhilash can take all three bags on the train or **"no"** if he cannot.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1 1 1 15 5
```

- Output:
```
yes
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The chef can send the first and second bags by goods train(since 1 + 1 =2 <=15) and carry the third bag with him (since 1 ≤ 5).**
