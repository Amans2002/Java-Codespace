# [Problem: Count Different Bits](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/crg3gtl4b9s0)

Count the number of differing bits between two given numbers, **n, and m**.

## Input

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers **n and m**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the number of differing bits between two given numbers, **n, and m**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3 7
```

- Output:
```
1
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Binary representation of 3 = 011,
Binary representation of 7 = 111,
So, Only 1 bit is different in these numbers.**
