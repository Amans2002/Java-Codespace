# [Problem: Maximum Integer Gift](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/7k9u76gx9te0)

Newton got 2 integers, X and Y, for Christmas.
He wants to gift an integer to his friend. He will gift such an integer that is made by either adding, subtracting or multiplying his 2 integers (X and Y)
Find the maximum integers that he can gift his friend.

## Input

The first and the only line of the input contains 2 integers, X and Y

## Constraints

**-1000 ≤ X, Y ≤ 1000**

## Output

Output the maximum integers possible

## Sample

- Input:
```
-10 5

10 20
```

- Output:
```
-5
200
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Possible outcomes: (-10) + 5 = -5, (-10) - 5 = -15, (-10) * 5 = -50. The maximum integer is -5.**
- For case 2: <br> **Possible outcomes: 10 + 20 = 30, 10 - 20 = -10, 10 * 20 = 200. The maximum integer is 200.**
