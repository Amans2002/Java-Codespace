# [Problem: Finding Numbers with K Set Bits](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/cmj0s5kmvh3i)

You are given two integers, N and K. Determine if there exists any integer less than or equal to N which has exactly K bits set to 1 in its binary representation.

## Input

The input consists of a single line containing two space- separated integers, N and K

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 <br>
0 ≤ K ≤ 31**

## Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if there exists a number less than or equal to N with exactly K set bits. <br>
Print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

## Sample

- Input:
```
10 2
```

- Output:
```
Yes
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **In the example, the number 10 in binary is 1010, which has 2 set bits, so the answer is YES.**
