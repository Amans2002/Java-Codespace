# [Problem: What is the product?](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/wvh63lak6oek)

Given a positive integer n, calculate the product of all its non- prime digits. A digit is considered non- prime if it is not among {2, 3, 5, 7}.

## Input

An integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

## Output

Print an integer representing the product of all non- prime digits of n. If there are no non- prime digits in n, return 1.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1234
```

- Output:
```
4
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **2 and 3 are primes. hence product will be 1 * 4 = 4.**
