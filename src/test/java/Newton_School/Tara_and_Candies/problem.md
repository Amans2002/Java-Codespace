Tara loves candies. She has got X Rs. in her pocket, she wants to get as many chocolates as possible. Each candy costs 1 Rs, and Tara also has a unique advantage â€“ for every 3 candy wrappers she collects, she can exchange them for an extra candy. Your task is to help Tara determine the total number of candies she can get with the given X Rs.

## Input

The input consists of a single integer X, representing the amount of money Tara has.

## Constraints

**1 <= X <= 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print an integer, the total number of candies Tara can have.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5
```

- Output:
```
7
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **With 5 Rs. Tara can buy 5 candies. Now she has 5 wrappers, with 3 wrappers (2 remaining) she get one more candy. Total candies so far = 6(5+1) and the wrappers 2 (Remained out of 5) + 1 (That of new candy) = 3. So, she gets one more. <br>
Hence the total number of candies = 7.**
