# [Problem: Edward and Games](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/66zpk8u1ama4)

Edward plays "Game 23". Initially, he has a number n and his goal is to transform it into m. In one move, he can multiply n by 2 or multiply n by 3. He can perform any number of moves. Print the number of moves needed to transform n to m. Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.

## Input

The input consists of two space- separated integers **n and m**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 5⋅10<sup>8</sup>**

## Output

Print the number of moves to transform **n to m**, or **-1** if there is no solution.

## Sample

- Input:
```
120 51840
