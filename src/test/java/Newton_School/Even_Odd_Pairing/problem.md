# [Problem: Even Odd Pairing](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/r3l9gzhe51si)

You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to pair the digits of the number such that each pair consists of one even digit and one odd digit. <br>
Determine the maximum number of such pairs you can form using the digits of n. (If there are leftover digits after forming the pairs, you can discard them. )

## Input

Input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

## Output

Print an integer denoting the maximum number of even-odd pairs you can form from the digits of n.

## Sample

- Input:
```
98765
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **One can at max form two pairs: (9, 8) & (7, 6) or (9, 8) & (5, 6) or (5, 8) and (7, 6).**
