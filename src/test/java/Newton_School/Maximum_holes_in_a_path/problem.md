# [Problem: Maximum holes in a path](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/bce87f58ds8z)

In a land of binary paths, adventurers traverse roads made up of two types of terrain: clean roads represented by 1 and treacherous holes represented by 0. To determine the path's danger levels, your task is to find the maximum number of consecutive holes in the path.

## Input

The input consists of two lines:

- The first line contains an integer n, the size of array.
- The second line contains n integers, the type of the path (either '0' or '1').

## Constraints

**1 <= n <= 10<sup>6</sup>**

## Output

Print an integer representing the maximum number of consecutive holes in the path.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5
1 0 0 1 0
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **There are maximum 2 consecutive holes. So the output is 2.**
