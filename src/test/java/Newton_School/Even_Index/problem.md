# [Problem: Even Index](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/vgrhtbbzalb0)

Ram was given an array A, He was asked to print all the elements which are present at the even indices of an array i. e. (0th, 2nd, 4th, etc). Help Ram by writing the code.

## Input

The first line of the input will contain a single integer N, denoting the size of an array.
The second line of the input contains N space- separated integers, denoting the elements of array A.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> <br>
1 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>**

## Output

Print in single- line space- separated integers which are present in the even indices of an array.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

- Output:
```
1 3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Indices are as follows [0, 1, 2] so among them even indices are [0, 2] so the elements present at even indices are 1 and 3. Hence the answer is [1, 3].**
