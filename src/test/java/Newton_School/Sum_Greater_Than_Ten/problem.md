# [Problem: Sum Greater Than Ten](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/gstg7l1zwhji)

Ram has three digits a,  b, and c. <br>
Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to 10. <br>
Output "YES" if there is such a pair, and "NO" otherwise.

## Input

The only line of each test case contains three digits a, b, c (0≤a, b, c≤9 ).

## Output

Output "YES" if there is such a pair, and "NO" otherwise.

## Sample

- Input:
```
8 1 2
```

- Output:
```
YES
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **By choosing the digits 8 and 2 we can obtain a sum of 8+2=10 which satisfies the condition, thus the output should be "YES".**
