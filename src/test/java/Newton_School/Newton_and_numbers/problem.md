# [Problem: Newton and numbers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/rw75jtu6van2)

Newton likes to play with numbers. He is given two integers N and K. Find the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b, b+c, and c+a are all multiples of K. The order of a, b, and c does matter, and some of them can be the same.

## Input

The input line contains N and K separated by space.

## Constraints

**1≤N, K≤2×10^5** <br>
N and K are integers.

## Output

Print the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b, b+c, and c+a are all multiples of K.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3 2

5 3
```

- Output:
```
9

1
```
