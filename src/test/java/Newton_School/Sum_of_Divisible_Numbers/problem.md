# [Problem: Sum of Divisible Numbers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/ksib4nl1071h)

You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to write a function that calculates the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive, which are divisible by 2, 3, or 7.
<br>
Determine the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.

## Input

Input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the upper limit of the range.

## Output

Print an integer representing the sum of numbers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by 2, 3, or 7. ( Use long long to prevent integer overflow).

## Sample

- Input:
```
20
```

- Output:
```
144
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The numbers less than 20 that are divisible by 2, 3, or 7:

2 3 4 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 15 16 18 20

Adding these we get 144.
