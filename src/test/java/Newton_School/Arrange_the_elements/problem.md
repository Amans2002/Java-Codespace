# [Problem: Arrange the elements](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/6bu9rz108yg1)

You are fond of even numbers so, your friend gave you the task of arranging even numbers in an array. <br>
You are given an array of **N** integers. Your task is to arrange the array so that all the even numbers come before the odd numbers without changing their relative order.

## Input

The first line contains **N** denting the number of integers in the array. The next line contains **N** space- separated integers denoting the array elements.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 2.5*10<sup>4</sup> <br>
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print **N** space- separated integers denoting the array after rearrangement.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5
3 1 6 8 5

2
2 4
```

- Output:
```
6 8 3 1 5
