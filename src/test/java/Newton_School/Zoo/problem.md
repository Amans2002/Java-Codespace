# [Problem: Zoo](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/q8d7qw6g19j0)

You are given a word containing the letters **'z' and 'o'**. The word must adhere to a specific pattern: the number of **'z's** in the word should be half the number of **'o's**. For instance, if there are two **'z's**, there should be four **'o's**. Your task is to determine whether the entered word follows this pattern and can be considered similar to the word **"zoo"**. If it does, print **"Yes"**. If the word does not follow the pattern, print **"No"**.

## Input

The first line contains an input word of letters **'z' and 'o'** (in lowercase).

## Constraints

**1≤ Size of word ≤ 20**

## Output

Print **'Yes'** if the input word can be considered as the string zoo otherwise, print **'No'**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
zzzoooooo
zooo
```

- Output:
```
Yes
No
```
