You are given an integer target. Your task is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the target by starting from 0 and applying the following two operations:
1. **Double**: You can multiply the current number by 2.
2. **Increment**: You can add 1 from the current number.

## Input

target: An integer representing the target number to reach. (1 <= target <= 10^6):

## Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of steps required to reach the target.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3
```

- Output:
```
3
```
