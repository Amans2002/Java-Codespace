# [Problem: Number of Newtons](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/smgnhktln3h8)

Given a string, find how many "newton" can be formed using the characters of the given string.  

## Input

Input consists of a string, s ( 1 <= |s| <= 105)

## Output

Output an integer, the number of "newton".

## Sample

- Input:
```
newltoonbalnewxballpoton
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Here, the number of occurence of 'n' = 4
of occurence of 'e' = 2
of occurence of 'w' = 2
of occurence of 't' = 2
of occurence of 'o' = 4
So, we can form 2 "newton" using the letters.**
