# [Problem: Count Common 1's](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/ob4qy91rzzh6)

Determine the count of common 1's in the binary representations of two numbers, **n**, and **m**.

## Input

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers **n** and **m**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the count of common **1's** in the binary representations of two numbers, **n**, and **m**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3 7
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Binary representation of 3 = 011,
Binary representation of 7 = 111,
So, Only 2 common 1's in these numbers.**
