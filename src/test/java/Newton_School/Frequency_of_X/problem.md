# [Problem: Frequency of X](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/g001gtyaq6zy)

You are given a sorted array Arr[] of size N containing integers. Your task is to determine how many times a given number X appears in the array.

## Input

Input consists of 3 lines:
- The first line contains a single integer N representing the size of the array.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array Arr. The array is sorted in ascending order.
- The third line contains a single integer X whose frequency you need to find in the array.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> <br>
0 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> <br>
0 ≤ X ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print a single integer representing the number of occurrences of X in the array Arr.

## Sample

- Input:
```
6
1 2 2 2 3 4
2
```

- Output:
```
3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **In this example, the number 2 occurs three times in the array.**
