You are given three integers a, b, and k. You are to determine the sum of the first k natural numbers which are divisible by either a or b.

## Input

Input consists of three integers a, b, and k **(1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 100)**.

## Output

Print a single integer representing the sum of the first k natural numbers divisible by either a or b.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2 5 6
```

- Output:
```
33
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **In the example, the first 5 natural numbers divisible by either 3 or 5 are: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10. Their sum is 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 = 33.**
