# [Problem: Sum of non repeating numbers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/pimag811bgc0)

You're given an integer array, where each number exists in pair, but two integers occur once only. i. e. Except for these two integers, the count of all distinct integers is 2.  
Find the sum of these two integers that occur once in the array.

## Input

Input consists of two lines:
- The first line contains an integer n : the size of the array.
- The second line contains n space separated integers representing the array elements.

## Constraints

**1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup> <br>
1 <= arr[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>**

## Output

Print an integer, the sum of integers having the single occurence.

## Sample

- Input:
```
6
1 2 3 2 1 4
```

- Output:
```
7
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **3 and 4 occur exactly once.**
