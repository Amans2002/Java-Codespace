# [Problem: Divisibility Transformation](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/qcl33gwn1f02)

You are given an array A of size N. In one move, you can choose any index i and either decrease or increase the element on that index by 1. Find the minimum number of moves required to make all elements in the array divisible by K.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two integers N and K. <br>
The second line of the input contains N space seperated integers.

## Constraints

**1 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup> <br>
1 <= A<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>9</sup> <br>
1 <= K <=10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the minimum number of moves required to make all elements in the array divisible by K.

## Sample

- Input:
```
6 3
7 3 4 8 5 1
```

- Output:
```
5
```
