# [Problem: Symmetric numbers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/qzdat39n2osp)

You are given a number n. Your task is to count the total symmetrics numbers less than equal to n. <br>
A symmetric number is a number having even length and the sum of the digits in the first half is equal to that of the second half. For example 1001.

## Input

The only line of the input consists of a single integer n.

## Constraints

**1 <= n <= 10000**

## Output

Print an integer representing the count of symmetric numbers.

## Sample

- Input:
```
100
```

- Output:
```
9
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Symmetruc numbers less than 100 are : 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Hence the output is 9.**
