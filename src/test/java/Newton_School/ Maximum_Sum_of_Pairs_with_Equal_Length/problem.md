# [Problem: Maximum Sum of Pairs with Equal Length](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/qelf2nmlcuw7)

You are given an array 'arr' of n integers. Your task is to find the maximum sum of a pair such that the length of both integers in the pair is the same.

## Input

Input consists of two lines:
- The first line contains an integer n — the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains n integers arr[1], arr[2], …, arr[n] — the elements of the array.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> <br>
-10<sup>6</sup> ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>

## Output

Print an integer representing the maximum sum.

## Sample

- Input:
```
6
112 221 23 32 45 6
```

- Output:
```
333
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **We'll choose 112 and 221 for maximum sum, as they have equal number of digits.
