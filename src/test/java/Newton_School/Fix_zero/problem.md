# [Problem: Fix zero](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/29lcwp7wymim)

You are given a sequence of 5 integers A. Initially, Ai (1 ≤ i ≤ 5) assigns i. But due to some glitch, one of the integers in the array becomes 0. Find out which integer of A assigned 0.

## Input

The first line contains 5 integers A1, A2 ... A5.

## Constraints

**The values of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 given as input are a possible outcome of the assignment.**

## Output

If the integer assigned 0 was Ai, print the integer i.

## Sample

- Input:
```
0 2 3 4 5

1 2 0 4 5
```

- Output:
```
1

3
```
