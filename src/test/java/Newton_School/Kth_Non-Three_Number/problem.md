# [Problem: Maximise Value](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/v7eh8byp28rk)

Akash doesn't like integers that are divisible by 3 or end with the digit 3 in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Akash, too. Akash starts to write out the positive (greater than 0) integers which he likes: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, …. Output the **k<sup>th</sup>** element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 1).

## Input

 The input consists of an integer **k**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ k ≤ 1000**

## Output

Print one integer **x** denoting the **k<sup>th</sup>** element of the sequence that was written out by Akash.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2
3
```

- Output:
```
2
4
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **1, 2** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **1, 2, 4**
