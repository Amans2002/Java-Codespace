# [Problem: Product of reverse number](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/jyvnka5ku1fn)

You're given an integer n. Find product of n with its reverse number. <br>
For example: if n = 134 then the reverse number will be 431. It's given that n will not have 0 at the end i.e. n is not like 40, 50, 380. 

## Input

Input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

## Output

Print an integer denoting the product of n and its reversed number.

## Sample

- Input:
```
123
```

- Output:
```
39483
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **For the number 123, its reversed counterpart is 321. The product is 123×321=39483.** <br>
