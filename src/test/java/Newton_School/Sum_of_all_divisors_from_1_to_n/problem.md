# [Problem: Sum of all divisors from 1 to n](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/xat4lnfg40kv)

Given a positive integer N. The task is to find the value of Î£i from 1 to N F(i) where function F(i) for the number i is defined as the sum of all divisors of i.

## Input

You are given an integer n ( 1<= n <= 10^6).

## Output

Output an integer.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
```

- Output:
```
15
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
ans = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4)
= 1 + 3 + 4 + 7
= 15**
