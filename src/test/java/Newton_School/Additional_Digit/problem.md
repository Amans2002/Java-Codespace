# [Problem: Additional Digit](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/qnb8r9j2soi9)

You are given a positive number of length N and a single digit D ranging from 0 to 9. You have to insert this digit in the given number of length N such that the resulting number is the maximum possible.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and D denoting the length of the number and additional digit respectively.
- The second line of input contains a positive number of length N.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 100 <br>
0 ≤ D ≤ 9**

## Output

Print the resultant number of length N+1 which is the maximum possible.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2 5
4 4
```

- Output:
```
544
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **After inserting 5 at the different positions we get, 544, 445, and 454, out of which 544 is the maximum possible.**
