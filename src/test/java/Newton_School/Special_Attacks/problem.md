# [Problem: Special Attacks](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/x129akpkrxnc)

Yash is playing a mobile game. In the game, Yash can perform special attacks. However, one special attack costs **X** mana points to Yash.
If Yash currently has **Y** mana points, determine the maximum number of special attacks he can perform.

## Input

The first and only line of each test case contains two space- separated integers **X and Y** - the cost of one special attack and the number of mana points Yash has initially.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ X ≤ 100** <br>
**1 ≤ Y ≤ 1000**

## Output

For each test case, output the maximum number of special attacks Yash can perform.

## Sample

- Input:
```
10 30
6 41
```

- Output:
```
3
6
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **3 attacks of 10, 10 and 10 points** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **6 attacks of 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 and 6 points <br> Remaining=5**
