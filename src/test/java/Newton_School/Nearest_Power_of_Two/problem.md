# [Problem: Nearest Power of Two](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/mividxhsdp0g)

Given a positive integer n, determine the nearest power of 2. If two powers of 2 are equidistant from n, print the smaller one. <br>
A number x is considered to be a power of 2 if it can be written as 2y, where y is a non- negative integer.

## Input

Input contains an integer **n (1 <= n <= 10<sup>8</sup>)**.

## Output

Print the nearest power of 2. If two powers of 2 are equidistant from n, print the smaller one.

## Sample

- Input:
```
34

32
```

- Output:
```
12

8
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Nearest power of two is 32 from this number.** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **Nearest powers of two are 8 and 16. Both have difference of 4. Hence the answer is the smaller one.**
