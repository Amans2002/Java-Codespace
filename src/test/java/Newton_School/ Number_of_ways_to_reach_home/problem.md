# [Problem: Number of ways to reach home](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/3fl40d42l0ga)

HP is standing at a distance of X kilometers from her house. She can travel at most K kilometers in a single step. She wants to know the total number of ways to reach her home. Print it modulo 109 + 7 as the number of ways can be large.

## Input

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. <br>
Each of the next T lines contains two integers X and K.

## Constraints
**1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> <br>
1 ≤ X ≤ 10<sup>4</sup> <br>
1 ≤ K ≤ 10<sup>2</sup>**

## Output

For each test case, print the number of ways modulo 109 + 7. The answer for each test case should come in a new line.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2
3 2
2 2
```

- Output:
```
3
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **For the first test case, it can be done in 3 ways.
1+1+1 =3
2+1 =3
1+2 =3**
