# [Problem: Minimum Operations to make equal](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/z2wmzc31s4sj)

Given two numbers a and b. In one operation you can pick any non negative integer x and either of a or b. Now if you picked a then replace a with a&x else if you picked b then replace b with b&x. <br>
Return the minimum number of operation required to make a and b equal. <br>
**Note: Here & represents bitwise AND operation.**

## Input

There is single line of input with two space separated integers representing a and b

## Constraints

**0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9**

## Output

Print a single integer representing the number of minimum operations required to make a and b equal

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 12

100 100
```

- Output:
```
2

0
```
