# [Problem: Count Number With K Set Bits](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/mn8az71u4dxx)

You are given two integers, N and K. Your task is to find the count of numbers less than or equal to N which have exactly K set bits in their binary representation.

## Input

Input consists of a single line containing two space- separated integers, **N and K**.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 <br>
0 ≤ K ≤ 31**

## Output

Output a single line containing the count of numbers less than or equal to N which have exactly K set bits.

## Sample

- Input:
```
10 2
```

- Output:
```
5
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **In this example, the numbers less than or equal to 10 with exactly 2 set bits in their binary representation are 3 (0011), 5 (0101), 6 (0110), 9 (1001), and 10 (1010). So the answer is 5.**
