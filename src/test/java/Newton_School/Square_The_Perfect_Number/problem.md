# [Problem: Square The Perfect Number](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/j9zzrkofiour)

You are given an integer. Print the square of the number if it's a perfect number else print -1.<br>
**=> A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.**<br> A divisor of an integer **x** is an integer that can divide **x** evenly.

## Input

The input consists of a single integer N.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>**

## Output

Print the square of the number if it's a perfect number else print -1. 

## Sample

- Input:
```
28
7
```

- Output:
```
784
-1
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br>**Factors of 28 => 1+2+4+7+14 = 28, Hence, perfect number. 28<sup>2</sup> = 784**<br>
- For case 2: <br>**Factors of 7 => 1 != 7, Hence, not a perfect number. -1**
