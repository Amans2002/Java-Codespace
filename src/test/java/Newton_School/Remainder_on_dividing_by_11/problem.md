# [Problem: Remainder on dividing by 11](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/uh7ohjh4poyg)

Given a big positive number x represented as a string, find the value of x % 11 or x mod 11(remainder on dividing by 11). Output is expected as an integer.
NOTE: x is very large and is in the form of a string.

## Input

There will be a single line of input which will take a string representing the number x

## Constraints

**1 ≤ length of string x ≤ 100000**

## Output

Print an integer representing the remainder after dividing x by 11.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1345

231456786543567898765
```

- Output:
```
3

1
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **x = 1345
1345 % 11 = 3** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **x = 231456786543567898765
231456786543567898765 % 11 = 1** <br>
- For case 3: <br> **21:00 + 100 => 60 min = 1 hr <br> 21 + 1 = 22 and 100 - 60 = 40 <br> 22:40** <br>
