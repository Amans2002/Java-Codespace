# [Problem: Raj and Chocolates](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/drkkk4h18ch7)

At a birthday party, there were **n** children. Each child is given some chocolates. As the organizer of the party, Raj wants to give equal chocolates to each of the children. So he can either give or take chocolates from each of the children. Both operations cost **x** where **x** is the difference between the initial number of chocolates and the final number of chocolates of a child. Help Raj find the minimum total cost.
