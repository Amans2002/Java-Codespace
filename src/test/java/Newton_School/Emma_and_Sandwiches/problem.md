# [Problem: Emma and Sandwiches](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/675wuvkszo4z)

Chef Emma knew that each sandwich required exactly two pieces of bread and one slice of cheese. She had gathered n pieces of bread and m slices of cheese. Help her determine maximum sandwiches she can make using the resources.

## Input

The only line of input contains two space separated integers n and m representing the number of pieces of bread and the number of cheese slices.

## Constraints

**0 <= n, m <= 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print an integer representing the number of sandwiches Emma can make.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 3
```

- Output:
```
2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **For first sandwich: 2 breads and 1 slice cheese, remained resources: 3 breads, 2 cheese slices
For second sandwich: 2 breads and 1 slice cheese, remained resources: 1 breads, 1 cheese slices
Now, Emma cannot make any sandwich as there's only one bread left.**
