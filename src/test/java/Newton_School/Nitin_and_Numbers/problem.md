# [Problem: Nitin and Numbers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/he25cb0xupff)

IPL is around the corner. Nitin Menon loves to represent all the numbers in the form of 1 or 0 or some combination of it. Given a number **n**, you are asked to help him represent n as a sum of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals **(a number is called a binary decimal if it's a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1)**. Compute the smallest number of binary decimals required for that.

## Input

The input consists of an integer **n** denoting the number to be represented.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>**

## Output

Print the smallest number of binary decimals required to represent n as a sum.

## Sample

- Input:
```
121
5
```

- Output:
```
2
5
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **121 = 111 + 10 or 110+11** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **5 = 1+1+1+1+1**
