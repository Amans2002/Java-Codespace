# [Problem: Find Second Last Index](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/831vk7s6yc7t)

Given an array and an integer, you have to find the index of second last occurrence of x in the array.

## Input

The first line of input contains a number n, the size of the array. <br>
The second line of the input contains n space- separated integers representing the elements of the array. <br>
The 3rd line of the input contains an integer x, which is the number whose second last index is required as the output.

## Constraints

**2<=n<=10<sup>6</sup> <br>
0<=arr[i]<=10<sup>6</sup>**

## Output

Output contains a single integer representing the index of second last occurrence of x in the array. <br>
If there is no second last occurrence of x, then print -1.

## Sample

- Input:
```
6
1 2 4 6 9 2
2
```

- Output:
```
1
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **2 occurs at index 1 and 5 <br> Second last index = 1**
