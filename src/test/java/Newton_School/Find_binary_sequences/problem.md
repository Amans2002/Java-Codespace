# [Problem: Find binary sequences](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/7hfz1nlos0c1)

You're given an integer n. Find out the number of all binary sequences of length 2*n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
The anwer can be very large. So, you have to return answer modulo 109+7.

## Input

An integer: n ( 1<= n <= 104)

## Output

Return the number of binary sequences.


## Sample

- Input:
```
2
```

- Output:
```
6
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **There are 6 sequences of length 2*n, the sequences are 0101, 0110, 1010, 1001, 0000 and 1111.**
