`Shifted String`_
========================

Problem
-------
We have a string **S**\ |i| consisting of uppercase English letters. Additionally, an integer **N**\ |i| will be given.
Shift each character of **S**\ |i| by **N**\ |i| in alphabetical order (see below), and print the resulting string.

We assume that A follows Z. For example, shifting A by 2 results in C (A → B → C), and shifting Y by 3 results in B (Y → Z → A → B).
between **A**\ |i| and **Z**\ |i|, inclusive.
