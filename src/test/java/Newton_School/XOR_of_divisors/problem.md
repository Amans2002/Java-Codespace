# [Problem: XOR of divisors](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/q1r5nfm21qgr)

You are given a number n, and you have to tell XOR of all even divisors of n.

## Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6**

## Output

Print XOR of all even divisors of n.

## Sample

- Input:
```
8
```

- Output:
```
14
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **All even divisors of 8 = 2, 4, 8.
XOR(2, 4, 8) = 14.** <br>
