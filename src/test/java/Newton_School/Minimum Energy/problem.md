# [Problem: Minimum Energy](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/f8stfk802zqa)

There are N people living on a number line. i-th person lives at coordinate Xi​. You are going to hold a meeting that all N people have to attend. The meeting can be held at any integer coordinate. If you choose to hold the meeting at coordinate P, the i- th person will spend (Xi − P)2 points of energy to attend the meeting. Find the minimum total energy the N people have to spend.

## Input

The first line of the input consists of an integer N. The second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the co- ordinate where the people live.

## Constraints

All values in input are integers.
**1 ≤ N ≤ 100 <br>
1 ≤ Xi ≤ 100**

## Output

Print the minimum total energy the N people have to spend.
