# [Problem: Find Target in least steps](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/rw49w02j3f0e)

You are given an integer target. Your task is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the target by starting from 0 and applying the following two operations:
- Double: You can multiply the current number by 2.
- Increment: You can add 1 from the current number.

## Input

An integer representing the target number to reach. (1 <= target <= 10^6)

## Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of steps required to reach the target.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3
```

- Output:
```
3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Start with 0, add 1, double it to get 2, and then add 1 to reach 3 in total 3 steps.**
