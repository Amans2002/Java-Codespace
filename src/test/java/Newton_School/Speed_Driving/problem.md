# [Problem: Speed Driving](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/amqvzavfcgbd)

A particular type of race competition is conducted in college to check the speed driving skill of the students. Two students are chosen at random named Ram and Shyam. **Ram drives X kilometers in P hours and Shyam drives Y kilometers in Q hours.** <br>
Determine who is driving faster, else, if they are both driving at the same speed print(without quotes) **"Equal"**.

## Input

The only line of the input contains all four integers **X, P, Y, and Q** respectively describes in the problem statement.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ X, P, Y, Q ≤ 1000**

## Output

Print(without quotes) **"Ram"** if Ram's driving speed is more, print(without quotes) **"Shyam"** if Shyam's driving speed is more else print(without quotes) **"Equal"**.

## Sample

- Input:
```
20 4 30 10
```

- Output:
```
Ram
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Ram drives 20 km in 4 hrs i.e 5kmph where as Shyam drives only 30 km in 10 hrs i.e. 3kmph
Hence Ram's speed is more than Shyam's.**
