# [Problem: Number of Common Factors](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/xu8imv9l1op7)

Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.
NOTE: An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.

## Input

There is a single line taking two space-separated integers representing a and b.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000**

## Output

Print an integer representing the number of common factors of a and b.

## Sample

- Input:
```
12 6

25 30
```

- Output:
```
4

2
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **a = 12, b = 6. The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.** <br>
- For case 2: <br> **a = 25, b = 30. The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.**
