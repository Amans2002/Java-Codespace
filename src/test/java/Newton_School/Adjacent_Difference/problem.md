# [Problem: Adjacent Difference](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/86irx6rrc7z2)

Given a positive integer n, calculate the sum of the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent digits.

## Input

Input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

## Output

Print an integer denoting the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of adjacent digits.

## Sample

- Input:
```
1524
```

- Output:
```
9
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The number 1524, the absolute differences are:
|5-1| = 4
|2-5| = 3
|4-2| = 2
Total sum: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9**
