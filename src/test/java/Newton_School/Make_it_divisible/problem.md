# [Problem: Make it divisible](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/22wppqy6f9a0)

**You are given a positive number N which does not have leading zeroes in it. In one step you can select any digit from the number and remove it. For eg, you can select 3 from 2345 and the resulting number becomes 245. What is the minimum number of steps required to convert N to a number (greater than zero) which is divisible by 25? It is guaranteed that answer exists.** .

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer N.

## Constraints

**25 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>18</sup>**

## Output

Print the minimum number of steps required.

## Sample

- Input:
```
71345
```

- Output:
```
3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **You can remove 1, 3, 4 then the number becomes 75 which is divisible by 25. Hence the required answer is 3.**
