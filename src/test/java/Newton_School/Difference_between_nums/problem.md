# [Problem: Difference between nums](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/eedkfll6fcan)

Given three integers (num1, num2, num3), you need to determine whether one of the numbers is the difference between the other two numbers. If such a number exists, return "Yes". Otherwise, return "No". (Note: Output is case sensitive).

## Input

The only line of the input contains three space separated integers representing num1, num2 and num3.

## Constraints

**-10^9 ≤ num1 ≤ 10^9 <br>
-10^9 ≤ num2 ≤ 10^9 <br>
-10^9 ≤ num3 ≤ 10^9**

## Output

Print "Yes" if one of the numbers is the difference between the other two numbers, otherwise return "No".

## Sample

- Input:
```
15 7 8
```

- Output:
```
Yes
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **Since the difference between 15 and 7 is 8, which is the third number.
So the answer is "Yes".**
