# [Problem: Nearly prime numbers](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/cuyfaxhrlebp)

You're given an integer n. Find the total numbers of primes and nearly prime numbers that are less than equal to n. <br>
(Note- A number 'K' is nearly prime if either K+1 or K-1 is prime. )

## Input

You are given an integer n ( 2 <= n <= 105).

## Output

Print an integer, representing the total number of prime and nearly prime numbers.

## Sample

- Input:
```
10
```

- Output:
```
8
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **In this example:
2 3 5 7 - these are prime numbers and,
1 4 6 8 - these 4 numbers are nearly prime
Hence total numbers = 8.**
