# [Problem: Fib Sum](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/vtj7pbf19oek)

You're given a number N. Compute the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

## Input

Input consists of an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 40), representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to be summed up.

## Constraints

**1 ≤ K ≤ 100** <br>
**K** is an integer.

## Output

Print a single integer representing the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5
```

- Output:
```
7
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **The first 5 Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3. Their sum is 7.**
