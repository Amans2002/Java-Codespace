# [Problem: Check LCM](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/0mcjkmpw8344)

Given a number N. Find the maximum possible LCM that can be attained by any three numbers less than or equal to N.
**Note: LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple. Also, Numbers can be repeated.**

## Input

There is a single line of input that takes an integer as input representing N.
## Constraints

**1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6**

## Output

Print a single integer representing the maximum possible LCM that can be attained by any three numbers less than or equal to N.
## Sample

- Input:
```
9

7
```

- Output:
```
504

210
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **N=9
504 is the maximum LCM that can be attained by any triplet of numbers less than or equal to 9.
The triplet which has this LCM is {7,8,9}.**
- For case 2: <br> **N=7
210 is the maximum LCM that can be attained by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 7.
The triplet that has this LCM is {5,6,7}.**
