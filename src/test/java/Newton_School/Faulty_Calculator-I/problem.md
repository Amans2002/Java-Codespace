# [Problem: Faulty Calculator- I](https://my.newtonschool.co/playground/code/216ww03ugxpg)

You have bought a new calculator, but it seems to have a small problem: all its results have an extra 3 appended to the end. <br>
For example, if you ask it for 3 + 5, it'll print 83, and 4 + 12 will result in 163. <br>
Given two integers A and B, can you predict what the calculator will print when you ask it for A + B?

## Input

You are given two space separated integers on the same line, A & B-
- A (1 <= A <= 10<sup>5</sup>): An integer representing the first operand.
- B (1 <= B <= 10<sup>5</sup>): An integer representing the second operand.

## Output

An integer representing the calculator's output when you enter A + B into it.

## Sample

- Input:
```
5 2
```

- Output:
```
7 3
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: <br> **5 + 2 = 7. Append an extra 3, so 73.**
