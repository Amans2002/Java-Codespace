# [Problem: Max Power](https://www.codechef.com/problems/MAX2)

Given a binary number (of N bits) X. Find the highest power of 2 that divides this number.

Note: If the binary number is "100" then the highest power of 2 that divides it is 2 (as 2^2 = 4)

## Input

- The first line contains N the number of bits in the number
- The next line contains a binary number of N bits 

## Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- X = 0 or 1

## Output

The first and only line contains the max power of 2 that divides the given number

## Sample

- Input:
```
5
10100
```

- Output:
```
2
```
