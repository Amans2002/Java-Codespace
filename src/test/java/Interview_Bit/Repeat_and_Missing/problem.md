# [Problem: Repeat And Missing Number Array](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/repeat-and-missing-number-array)

You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.

Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.

Note: 
- Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
- In your output A should precede B.

## Input

A List containing the integer from 1 to **N** . The i-th integer is **A<sub>i</sub>**.

## Output

Output one array containing A and B like [A,B].

## Sample

- Input:
```
[3 1 2 5 3] 
```

- Output:
```
[3, 4] 
```

## Explaination

A = 3, B = 4
